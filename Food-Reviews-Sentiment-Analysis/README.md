# Food-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-
In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset, aiming to understand the sentiment expressed in the reviews and how it relates to the corresponding review scores on a scale of 1 to 5.

# Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we focus on hotel reviews and their associated scores to gain insights into customer opinions and satisfaction levels.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset from Kaggle. It consists of food-related reviews and their corresponding scores provided by customers. Each review is associated with a score ranging from 1 (low satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction). The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any irrelevant information and ensure privacy.

# Project Components
Data Preprocessing: The raw dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and removing stop words, to prepare it for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: We leverage state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques to analyze the sentiment expressed in each hotel review. This involves classifying the text as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Sentiment-Review Relation: We explore how the sentiment scores obtained from the sentiment analysis relate to the original review scores. This allows us to uncover patterns and trends in customer satisfaction.

Visualization: We create visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots to showcase the distribution of sentiment scores and their relation to review scores.
