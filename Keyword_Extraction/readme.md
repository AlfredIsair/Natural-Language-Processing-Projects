This repository hosts a Python-based Keyword Extraction Tool built using IPython widgets and Spark NLP. The tool leverages the YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) algorithm, providing users with an intuitive interface to input text and extract relevant keywords. The extracted keywords are displayed alongside the input text, with highlighting for easy identification. This tool is useful for tasks such as information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization in natural language processing (NLP) applications.
