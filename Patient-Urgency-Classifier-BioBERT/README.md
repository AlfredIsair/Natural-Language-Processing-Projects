# Patient-Urgency-Classifier

The Patient Urgency Classifier, a pivotal tool in real-world healthcare setups, has been meticulously crafted to prioritize and manage patient cases efficiently. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Spark NLP's **MedicalBertForSequenceClassification**, this application assesses the urgency of patients' conditions, classifying them into one of the three distinctive categories: 'High,' 'Low,' and 'Medium.' Healthcare professionals gain timely insights for precise intervention, tailored to the urgency level indicated by the model.

**Use Cases:**
