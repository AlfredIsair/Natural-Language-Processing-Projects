# Clinical-SDOH-Social-Determinants-of-Health-Analysis
# Clinical Text Processing for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) using Spark NLP

## Overview

This project utilizes Spark NLP to process clinical text, extract valuable information related to Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), and perform Named Entity Recognition (NER). The pipeline is designed to identify sentences, tokenize them, generate clinical word embeddings, and specifically recognize entities relevant to SDOH. The NER results are then converted into chunks for further analysis.

## Features

- **Clinical Text Processing:** The pipeline processes clinical text data to uncover valuable insights related to SDOH.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Specialized NER models identify and categorize entities such as demographic information, socio-economic factors, and other determinants related to health.

- **Word Embeddings:** The project incorporates clinical word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships within the clinical text.

- **Sentence Tokenization:** Sentences within the clinical text are accurately identified and segmented for analysis.
